* Who are the founders of the company?

Klaus Schauser and Jon Walker [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppFolio)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The idea came about when the two founders, Klaus Schauser and Jon Walker, utilize their IT backgrounds to realize that every small business was going to need software in the future. Real estate, which was (and still is) a predominately pen and paper business, was ripe for innovation.[reference](https://www.tidemarkcap.com/vskp-chapter/appfolio-consumer-extensions)

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

It is a public company, although they raised $30M before going public [reference](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/appfolio).

## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Appfolio is trying to solve the problem of integrating technology with real estate management. Currently, the business still is predominately run by pen and paper operations for small to mid-size portfolio managers. [reference](https://www.appfolio.com/company/who-we-are)

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 

Indended customer is small to medium sized (and in select cases, large) multifamily commercial real esatate operators. 

The US property management market size was $3.62B in 2021 but projected to grow to $6.16B in 2028 with a 7.9% CAGR [reference](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/united-states-property-management-market-106247)

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Appfolio's competitive advantage is their scale and propitery data. They have information that no other service can match (rents, expenses, estimates, etc.) As a result, they are able to offer AI based tools [link](https://www.appfolio.com/ai) that can provide a superior experience for operators. For example, they are able leverage AI to predict rents based on historcial and market rents in their database. [reference] (https://www.appfolio.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-award/)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)

Appfolio uses a varitey of tools to supor their service. They use alert based tools, such as NewRelic, DataDog, and Rollbar, to help monitor and provide real time alerts for any potential customer usage issues. They also use many off the shelf ML services, such as Document AI, to help power their machine learning reccomendations.

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Real estate mangement technology, also know as "proptech"

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?

Proptech has completely revolutionized the industry through IoT monitoring, online payments/fintech based payment/expense systems, and machine learning/AI predictions [reference](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/01/17/three-trends-driving-proptech-innovation-and-what-other-businesses-can-learn/?sh=6d9214cb12c3)

These trends will continue to accelerate and reshape the industry in the coming years. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

The main competitior are other online real estate mangement software providers, such as Buildium, Entrata, Yardi, Rent Manager, etc. [reference](https://www.g2.com/products/appfolio-property-manager/competitors/alternatives)

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Appfolio is the clear market leader, with over 14% market share in the proptech space. They have substantially moved the proptech space forward. [reference](https://6sense.com/tech/property-management/appfolio-market-share#:~:text=AppFolio%20has%20market%20share%20of,Entrata%20with%209.94%25%20market%20share.)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Being a public company, their KPI's are pretty straight forward. The main KPI's would be revenue growth, EBITA growth, and EPS growth. In addition to the financial metrics, number of paying managers, customer growth, and customer churn would be impiortant KPI's.


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

They are doing very well, as listed in the reference above they are the clear market leader. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I think leveraging Microsoft Azure's Machine learning suite would be a great place to start. From their engineering blog, it seems like they are using a lot of off the shelf solutions for their data products. I think they can intensily enhance the value of their reccomendations by building and testing their own ML models. 

I also think integrating Chat-GPT into their stack would be a great value-ad. They can enhance the tenant and manager experience by creating a more lifelike chatbot. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

It would help real estate operators extract more value through better reccomendations and reduced staffing costs. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Azure products (VM's, Synapse, Cosmos, Powerapps, PowerBI, etc) and the chat-gpt API/ 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

I think they are approperate because they will help enhance the value of the prodcut without significantly altering the customer experience.
